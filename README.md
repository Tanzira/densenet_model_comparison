# densenet_model_comparison
Trained and compared variations of densenet model with other known models including resnet and efficientnet. Compared using Imagenet, SVHN, CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ICSC datasets.
This was a course project where we compared variations of densenet with other models. We included another dataset that had skin lesion images and classified those as well. That dataset can be found here (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/isic-2019)
All other datasets including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, SVHN and Imagenet are available via pytorch.
